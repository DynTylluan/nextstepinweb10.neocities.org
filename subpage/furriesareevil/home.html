  <br>
  <p><b>Furries are pure evil.</b></p>
  <p>For long since I signed up for Neocities, I've noticed that furries were on the site, slowly consuming it.</p>
  <p>So much so, that it's become one of the site's featured tags, in the 7th row or whatever.</p>
  <p>Since 2001, maybe, they've been consuming the internet, and this <em>cannot</em> go on.</p>
  <p>So in 2021, I had enough. 20 years of them slowly consuming the internet? <b>NOT GOOD.</b></p>
  <p>Would you like to let them consume your site, or would you like to join the resistance? <b>The choice is yours.</b></p><br><br><br><br>
