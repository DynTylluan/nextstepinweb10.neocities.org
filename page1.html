  <b>Super Mario 64 Beta ROMs</b> <br>
  I have collected a couple Super Mario 64 prerelease ROM files.<br>
  Of course, I can't let you download them (Nintendo doesn't really play nice),
  but under copyright law, I can provide BPS patches to make your ROMs into mine.<br>
  All you have to do is click <a href="https://archive.org/details/super-mario-64-patch">here</a>.<br><br>
  
  <b><em>Note:</em></b> The files provided are meant to patch a USA rom of Super Mario 64.<br><br>
  <b>Date Information:</b><br>
  Jul17: A version of Super Mario 64 from July 17, 1995.
  Apr21: A version of Super Mario 64 from April 21, 1996.
  
  I also have a version from March 1996, and a version from January, but
  those are a little dangerous, so I'll probably wait to show those to you.
  Don't want to expose any <em>sensitive nature</em> too early, right?
  
  <em>No, but seriously, you don't want to know the true form of Peach's castle.</em>
