# Dump of The most Awesome Website Ever! (nextstepinweb10.neocities.org)

Sadly, I don't know all that much about the history of this website, all that I know is that it existed from at least 2021-01-16 to 2021-01-29 and that it linked to Mario 64 Beta patches and a joke section about furries online being a 'cancer that must be fought'.

Unlike with a lot of other websites, I only started to archive this one after it was "immediately shadowbanned and deleted after posting various rude comments on other site profiles, including telling dannarchy to get eye surgery, calling phils 'stupid' for 'wanting to be a cat' and 'trying to destroy the internet without the permission of sir tim', and telling hyper1ink to 'maybe learn web design' despite their own site being generated with Frontpage 4.0" (to quote Bytemoth https://cd5k.net).

I was able to save a fair bit of the website thanks to my web browser's cache, the Internet Archive, and also Google's WebCache helped a lot. As I only started to put together this website by using archives, I cannot promise that I have archived 100% of the website, but I think I got most of it.

If you have a copy of parts of this website that are not in this git, fork this one and request a merge (or send it to me via Discord Owly#6604).

Following this, just because I have mirrored a project, this also does not mean that the author endorses me or my work.

If you are reading this and are wondering why exactly [that this disclaimer](https://github.com/DynTylluan/disclaimer) is inside of this project, it is simply here as a blanket way for getting out of trouble if myself or the project owner gets into hot water in some way, just in case. This is a standard document that is in all of [my GitHub](https://github.com/DynTylluan/) mirrors and _does not automatically_ mean that the project owner is a bad person or to be untrusted.

You are welcome to delete this file, as it will not affect the main part of the project in anyway.
